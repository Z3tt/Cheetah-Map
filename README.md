### About the Project

> The Cheetah Research Project (CRP) of the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (Leibniz-IZW) has been established in the farmlands of central Namibia since 2001. The CRP team has been studying the cheetah population focusing on a variety of research topics such as behavioral ecology, spatial ecology, prey selection, population ecology, mating system, reproductive success, genetics, immunology, health status and human-wildlife conflict. The CRP aim is to provide information for evidence based decision making in conservation policy. The project findings have contributed to a better understanding of the cheetah mating system, the spatial ecology of free-ranging cheetahs and their immune system.
